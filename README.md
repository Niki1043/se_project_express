# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Project Overview

This project is setup in Express. A MongoDB database is setup and connected to the server. Routes, controllers and error handlers are setup to enable GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to the MongoDB database. The API is built using RESTful API standards. The functionality is tested using Postman.

The techonologies used include Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB and Postman.

## Creating a Full Stack Project

The project is now integrated with the a front end React application enabling new users to sign up and once logged in, add and delete their own cards, and like any card.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
